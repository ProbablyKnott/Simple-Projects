#Dungeon Crawl

This is an open project at the moment.

This is a text based dungeon crawl game where the map and enemies are placed at random.
I reccomend opening the map text file instead of going blind. Enemies move every time you move.
Everything has a set amount of health. I also want to implement some sort of exp/leveling system
